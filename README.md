### Applied Patterns

- MVC
- Factory Method

### Used Module Dependency Library

- RequireJS with Text plugin

### Used JS Library apart from VanillaJS

- JQuery
  - Why?
    - To save time in re-inventing lots of basic stuffs and putting more focus on the actual problem solving
- JQuery form plugin
  - Why?
    - I needed to make the file upload experience proper and useful. Also the sent response from node was visible rather than the actual app page. I had to intercept the ajax form submission anyways.

### Comments

Tried to use comments as less as possible, rather focused on meaningful naming and DRY approach to make the code more
readable and understandable. As according to the book **clean code**, your code should speak for itself; so use comments
only if it's a must.

### How to run

`npm install`

`npm start`
