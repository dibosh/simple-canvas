### Applied Patterns

- MVC
- Factory Method

### Used Module Dependency Library

- RequireJS with Text plugin

### Used JS Library apart from VanillaJS

- JQuery
  - Why?
    - To save time in re-inventing lots of basic stuffs and putting more focus on the actual problem solving
- JQuery form plugin
  - Why?
    - I needed to make the file upload experience proper and useful. Also the sent response from node was visible rather than the actual app page. I had to intercept the ajax form submission anyways.

### Comments

Tried to use comments as less as possible, rather focused on meaningful naming and DRY approach to make the code more
readable and understandable. As according to the book **clean code**, your code should speak for itself; so use comments
only if it's a must.

### Some personal remarks

I wished to complete the code in a day(though I was given 2 days, but I was busy with my job).
But if you look into the git log, you will see I have tried to use as much of
best practices as possible which delayed the submission a while. Lots of iterative development as taken place- midway refactor,
modularization, separation of concerns etc.
